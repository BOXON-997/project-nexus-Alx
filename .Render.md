# Render Deployment Guide – Project Nexus

This document describes how to deploy the Movie Recommendation Backend
to Render using Docker.

---

## Deployment Overview

The application is deployed as a Docker-based web service on Render.
Supporting services (PostgreSQL and Redis) are provisioned using Render’s
managed services. All sensitive configuration is provided via environment
variables.

---

## Services Used

- Web Service (Docker)
- PostgreSQL (Managed Database)
- Redis (Managed Cache)

---

## Web Service Configuration

### Service Type

- **Type:** Web Service
- **Environment:** Docker
- **Branch:** main
- **Root Directory:** repository root
- **Port:** 80

Render automatically routes traffic to the exposed container port.

---

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in the Render
dashboard (values are not committed to the repository):

### Django Configuration

- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- `DEBUG=False`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS=<render-app-domain>`

### Database Configuration

- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_HOST`
- `POSTGRES_PORT`

### Cache Configuration

- `REDIS_URL`

### External API

- `TMDB_API_KEY`

---

## Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

A managed PostgreSQL instance is created on Render.
Connection details provided by Render are mapped to the environment
variables listed above.

Django migrations are applied automatically during container startup.

---

## Cache Setup (Redis)

A managed Redis instance is created on Render.
The provided `REDIS_URL` is injected into the web service environment.

---

## Static Files

Static assets are collected using Django’s `collectstatic` command
during container startup. Nginx serves static files from the collected
static directory.
